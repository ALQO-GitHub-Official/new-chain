ALQO integration/staging repository
===================================

What is ALQO?
-------------

ALQO is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. ALQO uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network, using a  proof-of-stake minting system, combined with masternodes.

License
-------

ALQO is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/ALQOCRYPTO/ALQO/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of ALQO.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
